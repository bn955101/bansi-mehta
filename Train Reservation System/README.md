# Train Reservation System

Our project aims to help users to create video slideshows. Our system is a functional web application where users can upload audio files, photos and submit their email along. These details are used by our system to process the file to generate video and send a notification email to the user with a link to download the processed files. Along with this, we have maintain the video history of every user. Once a user logs in into the system, he/she will be able to find the previously created videos.   Additionally, we have implemented a coin based system. During the registration, each user will be given 90 coins by default. When one video is generated, 30 coins are deducted. So user can create 3 videos in all. After that, the system provides a page “Add Credit” for users to buy more credits. This page does not have any payment gateway integrated. But can help in simulating the flow of coin-based system. Payment gateway can be integrated as a part of future work.
