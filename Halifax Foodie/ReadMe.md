# Halifax Foodie

HalifaxFoodie, a website for foodies that will handle data using a variety of cloud
platforms, i.e., utilizing a multi-cloud deployment approach. The main objective is to
build a serverless food delivery system using multiple interconnected cloud services.
The focus of this website is on finding new restaurants, trying new dishes, and getting
assistance from the system. The restaurant may publish various cuisines as well as
their best dishes, which will be visible to users. The user must first register/login in order
to enjoy the portal's numerous features. The user may have a look around and place
orders from a variety of restaurants. They can also get assistance through online chat.
They could also give the dish a rating and compare it to other recipes. Machine learning
will be used to improve the user experience. The system will also be connected to
Google Analytics, allowing extensive information on user interaction with the website to
be generated.
